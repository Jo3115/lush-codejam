The following project has been created to demonstrate a desirable output of the Creative Programming code jam hosted by LUSH Digital.

This small project uses the TweenMax library found [here](https://greensock.com/tweenmax), which enables animation found within the project. 

In order to automate the mouse movement, the Perlin library is used, which can be found [here](https://github.com/josephg/noisejs/blob/master/perlin.js)

To see a demo of the project in action please click [here](http://oliverbcurtis.co.uk/codeJam2019/)

There are other great libraries to consider if you're interested in projects like this, one being the [sketch.js library](https://github.com/soulwire/sketch.js)
