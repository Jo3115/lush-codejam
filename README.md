The following project has been created to demonstrate a desirable output of the Creative Programming code jam hosted by LUSH Digital.

This small project uses the TweenMax library found [here](https://greensock.com/tweenmax), which enables animation found within the project. 

In order to automate the mouse movement, the Perlin library is used, which can be found [here](https://github.com/josephg/noisejs/blob/master/perlin.js)

To see a demo of the project in action please click [here](http://oliverbcurtis.co.uk/codeJam2019/). 

Things covered by the example:

* Bubble animation
* Automation of bubbles when no touch or cursor movement detected for 500ms
* Background colour change depending on bubble speed movement
* Audio - (Audio of the bubble movement has only been tested on a touch screen laptop. The audio of the bubbles should speed up/slow down depending on drag movement speed).


There are other great libraries to consider if you're interested in projects like this, one being [sketch.js](https://github.com/soulwire/sketch.js)

If you want to look at audio files there are many options found at [zapsplat](https://www.zapsplat.com/).
I would recommend testing your audio files in an online player to see how the audio is affected whilst in a loop/ handling increased/slowed down speed before adding them to your code - I found [timestretch](https://29a.ch/timestretch/) very useful!
